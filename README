This is a simple form that converts opcodes as server sees them to/from various values used by WoW client.
Don't expect it to magically give you all the opcodes.

Fields explanation:
Opcode (hex/decimal) - opcode as server sends and receives it.
Special (hex) - value used in NetClient__ProcessSpecialOpcodes / NetClient__JAMClientDispatch.
Auth (dec) - value used in NetClient__HandleAuthOpcodes / NetClient__JAMClientConnectionDispatch.
Offset (dec) - offset of the handler inside ClientConnection object.
Converted (dec) - offset of the handler inside Handlers array of ClientConnection object.
